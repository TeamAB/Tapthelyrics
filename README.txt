                                                Background of the Study 
                                                  
          As of today smartphones become one the most innovated phones on today’s era because of the fact that these are the hot area for mobile business software developers. Google, for its G1/Android OS smartphone, offers the Android Market, "an open distribution channel for mobile applications" featuring 1,000 apps and growing, including enterprise-focused third-party applications for exchange connectivity, office document access, and VPN, according to a Google spokesperson. Smartphones and mobile technology remain a hot area this means that the Mobile technology is now the center of innovations of IT people specially developers. There are different kinds of karaoke game that has been developed and released by different kinds of developers an example would be; StarMaker this game is developed by the StarMaker Interactive Inc. this kind of game app implements audio and text file synchronization, but focuses on how people sing the selected song correctly just like a real karaoke game. Not only StarMaker but many more karaoke game that you can found on the internet all are implemented on different kinds of technology like computer, tablets and especially on android platform mobile phones. Some are implemented with the use of dynamic java programming search method; this is when they directly synced the text file to the mp3 and read it as a video file, there is also a file syncing app that syncs directly the text file to the mp3 file and will be read as a video file on the Customized Media Player that they created. In terms of implementation there are many methods that can be used in order to implement this audio and text file syncing game app and to make this thesis proposal acceptable, the proponents have decided to create an own way of synching both files; audio and text file. Compatibility of the game app on different android devices would be included, compatibility in terms of the cores a mobile device have. In able to pursue this thesis proposal the group chose Eclipse as the IDE and use an open source platform Android SDK in order to implement and to debug the game easier because of the fact that android SDK is implemented through java programming and has a built in android emulator window that emulates the android environment to show how the android game app works.

                                            Technology Application Context 
                                                  
          Based on the researches the team had seen there are a lot of projects and software had been done which focuses on audio and text synchronization. Different approaches had been used in developing such. Some of them may have done their researches by modeling or using dynamic programming process, others focused more on the determining rhythm structure and on how to sync music signals or acoustic signals with text, and other different kinds of approaches. Through these researches the team had come up to develop a game which has a function of audio and text synchronization. There are a lot of new emerging or improved technologies nowadays that can be used in different fields or areas. One of which are the technologies that are used in building new functionalities and more advanced mobile phones or also known as smartphones. Android is one of the technologies or platform that is used on smartphones. Many manufacturers and developers chose to use Android for some reasons that Android is an open source platform; it is easier for them to develop new functionalities and applications because it can be modified and improved anytime. Not only that, some manufacturers prefer android for it is cheaper than other mobile platforms. Lastly, it has wide range of libraries for 2d, 3d, image, audio and video files. Manufacturers do not need to spend a large amount of money to have an agile development of software and applications for in android; it somehow helps the manufacturers and developers on having a good start on creating applications. As the team had done researches about the languages that can be used in developing an android application, the team had decided to use android sdk plugin on Eclipse IDE. Using android sdk on eclipse is a good preference for it can help the team on understanding the process of developing an application or project and on creating the project at the same time. This plugin is useful to eclipse for it extends its capabilities and makes it easier to create an application with the packages added by using the plugin. Also it provides a guide project set up to guide the developer on how to start a project, as well as tools integration, custom XML editors and debug output pane. With these advantages and functions it shows that it is credible enough to use eclipse with android sdk plugin. In this study, the proponents will use not all but some built-in classes of android SDK. One of the classes that the proponents will use is the Media Player class for this is a built-in class that enables to play, pause, resume, and other functions that deals with a media file. Since, this study deals with an audio file, the team needs to use Media Player class only on the part of playing the audio file. Another class that the proponents will use is the BufferedReader class, as for this class, this will only be used for reading the text file. Both classes are needed for this study focuses on the synchronization of both audio and text file. The team had based this kind of process in a research wherein the researchers used two files in order to sync the audio and text in an mp3 file. As what has been mentioned above, the team will also sync the audio and text file but not in an mp3 file, it will be synced according to its timeframe. Stating this, it means that the team will do the synchronization manually without using any classes of android. What the proponents will do first is to get the timeframe of each word in an audio file and convert or put each word and its timeframe in a text file using Audacity. Audacity is an audio editor software wherein you can record, play and edit music or sounds and it has this function wherein it can easily convert your edited audio into your preferred file. The team will use this software in getting the timeframe for it is easier to understand and use. Second would be, after knowing the timeframe of each word then will be the time that the proponents will use the timeframe and create a method of syncing both files in eclipse IDE. Another function that this study will be focusing on aside from the synchronization of audio and text file, the proponents will also define a method for the randomization of the displayed words using the words from the text file. The randomization of texts is important for it will serve as the choices for filling in the blanks of the game. The proponents are also going to have a domain server in order to have an efficient way of handling the files of the application. This server will have the following files that will be used for the application; the text file and the media file. When the player wants to add a new song for the application, the player will just have to tap the download button to get the files then the application will automatically process the files to start the game. The team had come up to create an android application using android sdk plugin on Eclipse. The application that will be created is a karaoke game which is composed of OPM songs. This is different from other stereotyped karaoke games for in this game it does not evaluate the times the player had reached the desired tone or pitch but it evaluates the number of times the player had answered the missing lyrics of the song. While the song is playing, the player should be able to identify and tap the missing lyrics on the boxes displayed on the screen in order to fill in the blanks in a given period of time.

                                                  Objectives of the Study

The general objective of this study is to develop an Android game app that will sync audio and text file to be used on the game. 
The specific objectives are:

                                             Significance of the Study

          The significance of this study is to be able to preserve old pinoy songs and music. As what the team had observed, Filipinos love to sing either in parties or in karaoke bars. It shows that despite their busy schedule they still get to spare some time to sing their heart out. This kind of attitude of Filipinos has been a part of the tradition. Now, in this present time, technology is fast growing and emerging and had made many different kinds of devices, software and appliances. In this kind of lifestyle, people tend to be amazed on new developments that make them forget the old Filipino songs and traditions. In order to preserve those OPM songs, the team will develop a karaoke game on android for not maybe all but a number of Filipinos are using smartphones with android as its mobile OS. The importance of this study does not only focus on preserving the OPM songs but also to let the team learn on developing a project from a new language or platform specially on the part wherein the synchronization of audio and text are going to be done, not only that, to add a new approach to the technology world as for the part of the sychronization. Other researches had been done in different languages such as java and more but in this study, the group will use android SDK and its media classes and functions to develop a karaoke game which consists of audio and text synchronization.

                                        Scope and Limitations of the Study

          The study will generally focus on implementing audio and text file synchronization that enables to do the planned functions. This thesis proposal must be implemented with the use of android SDK plugin of eclipse and must use sample android SDK open source programs. Use android sdk class MediaPlayer as the main class on playing the audio file and BufferReader for getting the inputted text from the text file. Audacity will be used on getting the lyrics’ start-second and end-second of each word to be used on the game. The thesis proposal would also focus on android game development and will only use popular OPM songs.

                                             Technology Background

          Many android game or apps are done within a day, nowadays. For developers seek to develop many android games as much as they want in order to create new and more exciting, adventurous or educational games for the people who are using android as their mobile platform. Also as what the team had observed, even though IOS could develop many different kinds of applications and games, many users still prefer android not only for its free downloads but for the games itself. For in android, aspiring developers can learn and create games in their own way. 
          As for the part of the text and audio synchronization, many researches have been done with this kind of area but in a different approach. Other researchers may have focused more on audio signals and acoustic signals still, all have the same area and that is to sync audio and text. Looking at the games that have been developed using android, specifically the karaoke games, it shows that developing an android game with a function of audio and text synchronization, this study can be done. For seeing android’s classes and libraries it is convincing that it is possible to develop a karaoke game in android with a function of audio and text synchronization.

                                                  Description

          TapTheLyrics is an android karaoke application game that syncs audio and text file. It is much more related and similar to a typical karaoke game that we can search and find on an android app store. We are using an open-source development tool called Eclipse, Android SDK and Wamp for managing of the songs which are manage using PHP. All the songs are saved in a specific directory which the Android must access if the user is going to play the game. The idea of the game came from a famous tv game show "The Singing Bee" where the host would provide the song. A portion of the song is performed by the band, and then the contestant must guess and attempt to sing the next line of the song. The user must have to guess all the missing lyrics in order to gain high score.

                                         How to Install the Application

In order to open and access the game, you must have an Eclipse as your integrated development enrivonment (IDE) on your desktop/s or laptop/s. Then, go to www.github.com, search for "Tapthelyrics" and download the source code. After downloading the source code file on github. Extract the files on the desktop or on any folder you want to. Open your Eclipse (IDE) and import the folder "Tapthelyrics" on your IDE and there you go!
